description: > We propose to develop an integrated, extensible, public, open-access databank on how humans think and communicate about abstract domains like space, time, and number. This ​A​bstract ​T​hought and ​L​anguage ​A​cross ​S​pace (ATLAS) Databank will consolidate many isolated studies of how space/time/number are represented in language, gesture, cognition, material artifacts, and cultural practice; it will thus reflect the integrated ‘ecosystem’ of abstract thought and communication. This heterogeneous data will be stored in a relational data structure (e.g., in PostgreSQL) that captures the multiscale hierarchical relations between variables, with an eye to future extensibility. Researchers will be able to explore and analyze the data in a variety of ways: spatially (using a global map of field sites) and temporally; by conceptual domain (e.g., numerical reasoning); by variable of interest (e.g., co-speech gesture); and using other information about the community (e.g., linguistic typology, economic development, formal education, etc.). Researchers will be invited to contribute new data, thus creating a living record of global ‘cognitive ecosystems.’
